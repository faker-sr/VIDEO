Tottenham Hotspur and Ipswich Town are set to square off once again this Saturday in what promises to be a thrilling rematch.

The first Premier League showdown between these two saw Ipswich take the bragging rights with a 2-1 victory, and Spurs will be eager to even the score.

Fresh off a hard-fought 1-0 triumph over Manchester United on February 16, Tottenham enters this clash riding a wave of momentum. In that encounter, Spurs proved sharper in front of goal, outshooting United 18 to 13 to secure all three points in front of their home crowd.

Meanwhile, Ipswich Town had to settle for a 1-1 stalemate against Aston Villa on February 15. The Tractor Boys were under siege for most of the contest, getting outshot 25 to four, but they dug deep to leave Villa Park with a point in their back pocket.

Ipswich vs. Tottenham lineups, team news
Ipswich will be forced to shuffle the deck on Saturday, as Axel Tuanzebe's red card at Villa Park — courtesy of two bookable offenses — means he’ll be watching this one from the stands. In his absence, Ben Johnson is expected to slot into a more defensive role to fill the gap.

Tuanzebe’s suspension wasn’t the only setback for the Tractor Boys last weekend. Julio Enciso lasted just 17 minutes before a knee injury forced him off, adding his name to an already-crowded injury list alongside Wes Burns (knee), Conor Chaplin (knee), Chiedozie Ogbene (calf), and Christian Walton (groin).

On a more optimistic note, the trio of Sammie Szmodics (ankle), Sam Morsy (abdominal), and Leif Davis (undisclosed) haven’t been ruled out just yet. Davis, in particular, was close to making the cut for the Villa clash, so there’s still a chance he could get the green light for Saturday’s showdown.

Ipswich predicted lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Palmer (GK) — Johnson, O'Shea, Greaves, Davis — Cajuste, Phillips — Philogene, Hutchinson, Clarke — Delap

Injured: Wes Burns (knee), Conor Chaplin (knee), Chiedozie Ogbene (calf), Christian Walton (groin), Wes Burns (knee), Conor Chaplin (knee), Chiedozie Ogbene (calf), and Christian Walton (groin)
Suspended: Axel Tuanzebe

Not everything was sunshine and rainbows for Tottenham on the injury front last week, as Kevin Danso, Rodrigo Bentancur, and Son Heung-min were all forced to make early exits in the win over Manchester United. However, Ange Postecoglou remains optimistic that their issues were nothing more than minor bumps and bruises.


With that in mind, there's little reason to believe the trio won’t be ready to take the pitch against Ipswich. Meanwhile, there’s a flicker of hope that Timo Werner could shake off his hamstring woes in time for Saturday’s clash—though even if he does, a starting role seems unlikely.

On the longer-term injury list, Richarlison (calf), Dominic Solanke (knee), Micky van de Ven (thigh), Cristian Romero (thigh), and Radu Dragusin (ACL) remain sidelined.

Tottenham predicted lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Vicario (GK) — Porro, Danso, Davies, Spence — Bergvall, Bentancur, Maddison — Kulusevski, Tel, Son.

Injured: Richarlison (calf), Dominic Solanke (knee), Micky van de Ven (thigh), Cristian Romero (thigh), and Radu Dragusin (ACL)
Suspended: None

Ipswich vs. Tottenham prediction
Ipswich may have walked away from Villa Park with a hard-earned point, but they had their goalkeeper to thank for repeatedly bailing them out of trouble. Their struggles on home turf in the Premier League are no secret, and they’ll need another heroic effort to keep Spurs at bay.

McKenna’s squad won’t be pushovers by any means, but with Tottenham riding a wave of momentum—both in confidence and squad depth—they look primed to settle the score in East Anglia.

Prediction: Ipswich 0-2 Tottenham
